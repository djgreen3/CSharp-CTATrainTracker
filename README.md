# CSharp-CTATrainTracker
A simple C# program to retrieve arrival times for CTA trains

After obtaining a API key from the CTA dev website, you can easily plug it in to the trainKey variable and get train times.

There is a list of stations available at http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/ttdocs/default.aspx
This program will take the stop_id or parent stop_id, just assign whichever to the station variable.
